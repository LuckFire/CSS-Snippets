## Installtion
If you'd like to import this snippet, go to your **Themes tab, open Quick CSS** and paste the following:

    @import url("https://raw.githack.com/LuckFire/CSS-Snippets/master/WhiteChatbar/textbar.css")

## Credits
I got this idea from CapnKitten's Spotify Discord theme, seeing a white chatbar gave me the idea to make a snippet that does this.
