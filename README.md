# CSS Snippets for Powercord
These are some random CSS snippets I decided to throw together for either importing into themes or just using as is. If you wanna use these for themes, feel free to. Also note that these probably aren't coded the best way that they could be coded, they're only intended to work as is. 
### If you'd like to import all of these snippets, go to your themes folder, open a command prompt / powershell / terminal / or git bash and enter the following:

	git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/CSS-Snippets

### After you import them, you'll have to drag them all out of the CSS-Snippets folder into your themes folder. I suggest that instead of doing this, you should use @import because you keep your folder clean and have better management over all of them, but do as you wish.
