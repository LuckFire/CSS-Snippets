# CSS Snippets for Powercord
These are some unoriginal, random CSS snippets I threw together for importing into themes. If you wanna use these in any themes that you're making, go ahead. But be warned that nothing is coded to look pretty or be the best possible way to be coded, they're only intended to work as is.
