If you'd like to import this snippet, go to your **Themes tab, open Quick CSS** and paste the following: 

	@import url("https://raw.githack.com/LuckFire/CSS-Snippets/master/MoreRoundedBorders/borders.css")

The idea for this came from hellbound's Discord Revamp theme, there are some areas that make borders more rounded. This does exactly that, but makes even more borders more rounded. To figure out how to get the nitro credit line to disappear, I had to look at the original code bt that was basically it.
