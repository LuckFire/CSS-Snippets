## Credits
I got this idea from hellbound's Discord Revamp theme, there are buttons in there that are more rounded. Also, to figure out some of the elements and how to get this to work, I had to look at a bit of that code. 
#### TLDR: All credit goes to hellbound, for the idea and some of the code that I used to figure out some things.
